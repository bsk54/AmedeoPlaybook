Description: Amedeo Playbook is a single-page application designed to help you learn Chinese through real TV subtitles. 
It loads subtitle tracks for each episode (zh, py, or en, optional) and optional episode JavaScript files (vocabulary and grammar snippets). The app supports package navigation, keyboard control, and text-to-speech for sentence shadowing and vocabulary looping. Highlighted vocabulary words in subtitles open a pop-up with Chinese, Pinyin, and English.
